C++ project on our list is a temperature converter app that’s also a great way to get to grips with functions in C++. 

At this stage in our list of C++ projects, it made sense to me to ramp up the complexity of our C++ programs, and functions are a great way to do this.

If you want to write good C++ programs, functions will be essential for organizing your code and implementing basic D.R.Y principles. 

We’ll also be using more complex mathematical operations by converting temperatures between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin.

Let's check out how to build this temperature conversion app
Code Explanation:

Now we’ve created this C++ project, let’s review the main components of the program:

We included the iostream header for input and output.
We defined four conversion functions for: CelsiusToFahrenheit, FahrenheitToCelsius, CelsiusToKelvin, KelvinToCelsius
The main function displays a menu for the user to choose the type of conversion.
The user is prompted to enter the temperature value, and based on the choice, the corresponding conversion function is called.
The switch statement handles the user's choice and performs the appropriate conversion.
The converted temperature is then displayed to the user.
When you run this program, you’ll see a simple user interface that allows the user to input a temperature and select the type of conversion they wish to perform. 

Based on the selected choice, the program will output the converted temperature. 

I really like this C++ project because it provides a gentle introduction to functions while also extending our use of user input and arithmetic operations in C++.

How else could you expand this program? Maybe you could add sub-menus for different types of conversion? 

For example, you could add the option to toggle between temperature and pressure conversion. How would you do this? 

Hint: you’ll need an additional layer of conditional logic and new conversion functions.
